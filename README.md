[Check the live app!](https://mernnote-yn2t.onrender.com/)

## 🎯 Project Overview

MERNnote is a comprehensive full-stack notes application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This project features modern authentication via SuperTokens, rate limiting with Upstash Redis, and supports both email/password and OAuth (Google, GitHub) authentication. It represents a significant milestone in my journey from frontend-focused React development to full-stack web development.

## 📚 My Programming Learning Journey

### **Before MERNnote: Foundation Building**
My programming journey began with frontend fundamentals and progressively advanced through React concepts:

- **Early Projects**: Started with basic JavaScript implementations like `JSAssignment-fibonacci` 
- **React Fundamentals**: Built foundational knowledge with `react_state_exercise` and `state_lifting`
- **Interactive Applications**: Developed `tic-tac-toe`, `calculator_app`, and `movieListProject`
- **Previous Notes App**: Created a simpler `Notes-App` using React for frontend-only functionality

### **The MERN Leap: What This Project Taught Me**

MERNnote represents my transition from frontend-only applications to full-stack development. Here's what I learned:

## 🛠️ Technologies & Skills Acquired

## 🎯 Final Reflection

MERNnote represents more than just a notes application, it's a testament to my growth as a developer. This project challenged me to think beyond frontend development and understand the complete web development ecosystem. Every line of code taught me something new about full-stack development, and I'm excited to apply these skills to future projects.

The journey from building simple React components to creating a full-stack application with database management, and deployment has been incredibly rewarding. This project has given me the confidence to tackle more complex full-stack challenges and continue growing as a developer.

**Total Development Time**: ~8 hours across 3 days
**Lines of Code**: ~2,500 (Frontend: ~1,500, Backend: ~1,000)
**Commits**: 45+ commits showing iterative development process
**Technologies Mastered**: 10+ new technologies and frameworks including SuperTokens, Upstash Redis, Vite, and Tailwind CSS

This README itself represents my journey—from someone who knew React basics to a developer capable of building full-stack applications. The next phase involves mastering these technologies through repetition and real-world projects until full-stack development becomes my natural workflow, while expanding into Next.js for enhanced React capabilities and deepening my MERN stack expertise.
